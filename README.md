# 👋 Hi, I’m Farooqi  

## 👨‍💻 About Me  
Data Scientist with a Master’s in Data Science from TU Dortmund and hands-on experience in both research and industry. Skilled in Python (NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, scikit-learn, spaCy), R, SQL, Power BI, and Azure, I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights through machine learning, Bayesian modeling, and advanced statistical analysis.  

My experience spans building semantic search pipelines with LLMs, database architecture and ERD design, and developing interactive dashboards for cross-functional teams. I’ve applied statistical methods such as time series forecasting, changepoint detection, clustering, and MANOVA across real-world datasets, alongside projects in hypothesis testing, generalization, and cognitive modeling.  

Additional technical strengths include Terraform, DBT, LaTeX, Linux, and front-end integration (HTML, CSS). I enjoy bridging technical depth with business needs, making data-driven solutions both accessible and impactful. Passionate about problem-solving, I thrive in collaborative environments where innovation meets practical application.
